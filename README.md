# CTags for your project's gems

## Installation

Just run

    gem install gemtags

## Usage

In your project directory, run 'gemtags'. This will create a file called *.gemtags* with all CTags for the gems referenced in your Gemfile. (This file is platform specific and should be added to .gitignore.)
